<h1><i><u>Radha krishna</u></i></h1>
<p>Lord krishna and goddess Radha are inseparable; They always come together as one name Radha Krishna. The name Lord Krishna is derived from the Sanskrit word Krishna, which is primarily an adjective meaning "black", "blue", "dark blue" or <b>"all-attractive"</b>. It is believed to have eight incarnations of Lord Vishnu. People send Janmashtami Quotes and wishes to loved ones on Janmashtami. He is probably the most popular of all the heroes of Hindu mythology. The word Radha means the greatest lover and worshiper of Krishna. Shri Radha is the feminine aspect of Shri Krishna and is not separate from Krishna.
